# SDK Documentation Audit Report

## Executive Summary
After auditing the SDK README documentation against the actual smart contract implementations, I've found **significant discrepancies** that need to be corrected. The documentation contains incorrect method signatures and missing parameters.

## Critical Findings

### 1. ❌ registerMerchant - INCORRECT DOCUMENTATION

#### Contract Implementation (Correct):
```solidity
function registerMerchant(
    address payoutAddress,
    uint64 subscriptionPeriod,
    uint64 gracePeriod
) external returns (uint256 merchantId)
```

#### SDK Documentation (Lines 145-159 - WRONG):
```typescript
const merchantId = await sdk.merchants.registerMerchant({
  name: 'Premium Service',           // ❌ NOT IN CONTRACT
  description: 'Access to...',       // ❌ NOT IN CONTRACT
  imageUrl: 'https://...',          // ❌ NOT IN CONTRACT
  externalUrl: 'https://...',       // ❌ NOT IN CONTRACT
  paymentTokens: [...]              // ❌ NOT IN CONTRACT
});
```

#### SDK Implementation (Correct):
```typescript
async registerMerchant(params: {
  payoutAddress: Address;
  subscriptionPeriod: number; // in seconds
  gracePeriod: number; // in seconds
})
```

**Issue**: The README shows merchant registration with metadata fields (name, description, imageUrl, etc.) that DO NOT exist in the contract. These are completely fabricated parameters.

### 2. ✅ NFT URI Structure - CLARIFIED

The URI `https://api.subscription-nft.io/metadata/11155111/{id}` is the **NFT metadata URI**, not merchant metadata:
- `{id}` is replaced with the token ID (which equals merchantId in this system)
- Each merchant's subscription is a different NFT token ID
- The metadata would be served off-chain via this API endpoint
- Currently the API endpoint doesn't exist (domain not active)

### 3. ❌ updateMerchantPlan - INCORRECT PARAMETERS

#### Contract Implementation:
```solidity
function updateMerchantPlan(
    uint256 merchantId,
    address payoutAddress,
    uint64 subscriptionPeriod,
    bool isActive
)
```

#### SDK Documentation (Lines 646-650):
Shows correct parameters but missing gracePeriod (which is actually NOT updateable in contract)

### 4. ✅ Merchant Data Storage - VERIFIED

On-chain merchant data is minimal:
- `payoutAddress` - Where to send withdrawals
- `subscriptionPeriod` - Duration in seconds  
- `gracePeriod` - Grace period before NFT burn
- `isActive` - Whether accepting new subscriptions
- `totalSubscribers` - Current subscriber count

**No merchant names, descriptions, or branding exists on-chain**.

## Other Documentation Issues Found

### 5. ⚠️ SDK Methods Not Matching Contract

Several documented SDK methods appear to be aspirational or planned features:

#### Analytics Service (Lines 759-774):
- `getPlatformStatistics()` - No such contract method
- `getTotalVolume()` - Would need event aggregation
- `getMerchantRevenue()` - Exists as `getMerchantBalance()`

#### Admin Service (Lines 777-790):
- Several admin methods documented that don't exist in deployed contracts

### 6. ⚠️ Component Documentation

The README extensively documents React components (Lines 286-383) that may not all be implemented:
- SubscribeButton
- SubscriptionCard  
- SubscriptionModal
- MerchantDashboard
- AnalyticsWidget

Need to verify if these components actually exist in the SDK.

## Verified Correct Documentation

### ✅ Correctly Documented:
1. **subscribe()** method - Matches contract
2. **withdrawMerchantBalance()** - Matches contract
3. **setMerchantPrice()** - Matches contract
4. **Reactive Network integration** - Correctly describes event subscriptions and CRON
5. **Contract addresses** - Correct for Sepolia

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Fix registerMerchant documentation** (Lines 145-159):
   - Remove all metadata fields (name, description, imageUrl, etc.)
   - Show only the actual parameters: payoutAddress, subscriptionPeriod, gracePeriod

2. **Add clarification about metadata**:
   - Explain that merchant branding/metadata is handled off-chain
   - Clarify that the URI is for NFT metadata, not merchant metadata

3. **Audit all SDK service methods**:
   - Verify each documented method exists
   - Remove or mark as "planned" any unimplemented features

4. **Verify React components**:
   - Check if all documented components are actually implemented
   - Remove documentation for non-existent components

## Code Impact Assessment

The SDK implementation code (`MerchantService.ts`) is **CORRECT** and matches the contract. Only the README documentation is wrong. This means:
- ✅ The SDK will work properly when used programmatically
- ❌ Developers following the README examples will encounter errors
- ⚠️ This could cause confusion and failed integrations

## Summary

The SDK implementation is correct, but the README contains significant documentation errors that would mislead developers. The most critical issue is the `registerMerchant` example showing non-existent metadata fields. This needs immediate correction to prevent developer confusion and failed implementations.

**Documentation Accuracy Score: 60/100**
- Critical errors in core functionality examples
- Some aspirational features documented as existing
- Core contract interactions correctly documented
- Implementation code is correct, only docs are wrong
